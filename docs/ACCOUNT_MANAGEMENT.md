# Account Management Features

This document outlines the account management functionality implemented in EzJob.

## Features

### Data Export
- **Comprehensive Export**: Exports all user data including applications, resumes, files, profile, and preferences
- **JSON Format**: Downloads data as a well-formatted JSON file with timestamp
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress during export process
- **Data Summary**: Displays what will be exported before download

### Account Deletion
- **Complete Data Removal**: Removes all job applications, resumes, uploaded files, and profile data
- **Storage Cleanup**: Deletes all files from Supabase storage buckets
- **Graceful Logout**: Signs out user without triggering email confirmations
- **Clear Warnings**: Shows exactly what data will be deleted

## Implementation Details

### Current Approach
The current implementation focuses on **data deletion** rather than auth user deletion to avoid unwanted email confirmations from Supabase:

1. **Delete all user-generated data** (applications, resumes, files, profile)
2. **Clean up storage buckets** (avatars, documents)
3. **Sign out the user** immediately
4. **No email changes** to prevent confirmation emails

### Why This Approach?
- ✅ **No unwanted emails**: Avoids triggering Supabase email confirmations
- ✅ **Complete data removal**: All personal data is permanently deleted
- ✅ **Clean user experience**: User is signed out and redirected appropriately
- ✅ **GDPR compliant**: Personal data is removed (auth stub remains but contains no PII)

### Production Considerations

For production environments where you need to completely remove auth users, consider implementing a server-side endpoint:

```javascript
// Example Edge Function or API endpoint
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY // Server-side only!
)

export async function deleteUserCompletely(userId) {
  // 1. Delete all user data (same as current implementation)
  await deleteUserData(userId)
  
  // 2. Delete auth user (requires service role key)
  await supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.deleteUser(userId)
}
```

## Security Notes

- All deletions are user-scoped (uses `user_id` filters)
- Storage files are deleted using user-specific paths
- No admin privileges are required for the current implementation
- Data export does not include sensitive authentication data

## User Experience

### Data Export
1. User clicks "Export" button
2. Shows real-time progress messages
3. Downloads JSON file automatically
4. Success notification confirms completion

### Account Deletion
1. User sees warning with data summary
2. Confirmation dialog shows exactly what will be deleted
3. Progress indicator during deletion
4. User is signed out and redirected to homepage
5. Success message confirms completion
